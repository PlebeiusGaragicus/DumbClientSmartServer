## Summary

In 2023, Oregon's real gross domestic product (GDP) reached $260.11 billion U.S. dollars, reflecting its economic performance within the United States. This data is part of a broader analysis covering the period from 2000 to 2023, with GDP values adjusted for inflation using chained dollars—2012 dollars for years up to 2016 and 2017 dollars thereafter. The GDP metric represents the total market value of all final goods and services produced within Oregon during this timeframe.

This comprehensive approach ensures that users have access to reliable data and expert insights necessary for strategic planning and decision-making.

Oregon's 2023 Economic Performance Index provides additional context by assessing the state's economic performance relative to other states and D.C., using metrics such as GDP per capita, labor force participation rate, net business creation, inequality (Gini Index), poverty levels, median household income, and net interstate migration. The index indicates that while Oregon’s overall economic performance in 2023 is slightly higher than in 2011, its rank has declined from 26th to 27th due to changes in these metrics.

The state's industrial composition contributes to this relative decline; for example, Oregon has a smaller share of industries like technology and manufacturing compared to other states. This affects its GDP growth potential and economic resilience. Additionally, the state faces challenges such as higher living costs and limited access to certain resources, which can impact business operations and attract fewer investments.

In 2023, the real GDP of Oregon increased by about 2.3 percent compared to the previous year, while the GDP of the United States grew by around 2.9 percent. This growth in Oregon's GDP is part of a long-term trend that saw its most significant increase in 2000, with an 8.5 percent rise from the previous year. These figures highlight both the state's economic resilience and the challenges it faces in maintaining competitive growth rates compared to national averages.

Overall, while Oregon has shown steady economic growth over the years, its performance relative to other states indicates areas for potential improvement, particularly in diversifying its industrial base and addressing regional economic disparities.

Oregon’s 2023 Economic Performance Index
Experts: 
Introduction
The economic performance of a state is generally measured by economic growth (GDP), unemployment, and labor force participation, among others. CSI developed the Economic Performance Index to assess the relative economic performance of 50 states and the District of Columbia. It is comprised of seven metrics: GDP per capita, labor force participation rate for people aged 18 to 64 years, net business creation, inequality as measured by the Gini Index, the percentage of people of all ages in poverty, the median household, and net interstate migration.
The index starts in 2011 and is calculated annually. Construction of the index involves ranking each of the seven component metrics across 50 states and D.C. for each year and subtracting the rank from 100. Therefore, higher (lower) index values indicate the state is more (less) competitive. To arrive at the Economic Performance Index, each of the seven component metrics is weighted evenly. The indices for each state and D.C. are then ranked with 1 equaling the highest index value and 51 equaling the lowest index value.
CSI's Free Enterprise Indices rely on the data available as of October of the previous year. Therefore, current data across policy areas may be different than that reported in the annual Free Enterprise Report. CSI updates and releases the report in December every year.
 
Key Findings
 
Oregon’s Economic Performance Index
It is especially important to recognize that the Economic Performance Index is measuring Oregon’s performance relative to 49 other states and the District of Columbia and not the performance of Oregon in isolation. As shown in figure 1, the Oregon Economic Performance Index was 73.6 in 2011, and it peaked in 2020 at 82.1 before declining 10% from 2020 through 2023 to 73.9. The net result was that Oregon’s economic performance rose 0.4 percent and its rank relative to all other states went from 26thin 2011 to 27th in 2023.
Oregon’s overall economic performance relative to other states and D.C. is slightly higher in 2023 than in 2011. However, the drop in rank from 26th to 27th indicates its relative performance has declined. As discussed later in this report, the industrial composition of Oregon’s economy differs from the nation as a whole in ways that possibly make it difficult for it to be among the top state economies. For instance, Oregon’s agricultural sector is a larger share of its economy than many states, and this sector tends to be among the lowest for income derived from salaries and wages. Similarly, Oregon’s professional-scientific-technical and information sectors are a smaller share of the economy than many states, and these sectors tend to be among the highest for income derived from salaries and wages.
Figure 1
 
Oregon’s Economic Performance Index Component Metrics
Figures 2 and 3 show the evolution of the economic performance component metrics between 2011 and 2023 as measured on the relative index. Three metrics experienced declines: net business creation decreased 6.4 percent, net interstate migration fell 37.8 percent, and inequality dropped 1.3 percent Four metrics increased: the percentage of people of all ages in poverty increased 10.8 percent, median household income rose 16.7 percent, GDP per capita increased 16.7 percent, and labor force participation gained 17.9 percent.
Net interstate migration was the only performance metric that declined as a result of a decline in the underlying data for Oregon. In 2017, Oregon’s net interstate migration was 40,059, but in 2023 it was -29,370, a reversal of -69,429. The underlying data for Oregon’s other economic performance indicators all improved, but the state’s relative performance may have improved or worsened due to lower or higher performance in other states. For instance, inequality in Oregon, as measured by the Gini coefficient decreased from 0.459 to 0.451 ye... [truncated]","Sources:
